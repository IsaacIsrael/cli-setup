# Triage Labels

The skills speak in terms of canonical triage roles — two **category** roles and five **state** roles. This file maps those roles to the actual label strings used in this repo's issue tracker.

## Category roles

Every triaged issue carries exactly one category role.

| Label in mattpocock/skills | Label in our tracker | Meaning                          |
| -------------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `bug`                      | `bug`                | Something is broken              |
| `enhancement`              | `enhancement`        | New feature or improvement       |

## State roles

Every triaged issue carries exactly one state role.

| Label in mattpocock/skills | Label in our tracker | Meaning                                  |
| -------------------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `needs-triage`             | `needs-triage`       | Maintainer needs to evaluate this issue  |
| `needs-info`               | `needs-info`         | Waiting on reporter for more information |
| `ready-for-agent`          | `ready-for-agent`    | Fully specified, ready for an AFK agent  |
| `ready-for-human`          | `ready-for-human`    | Requires human implementation            |
| `wontfix`                  | `wontfix`            | Will not be actioned                     |

When a skill mentions a role (e.g. "apply the AFK-ready triage label"), use the corresponding label string from these tables.

Edit the right-hand column to match whatever vocabulary you actually use in your GitHub repo.

## Content labels

These are not triage roles — they tag an issue by what kind of artifact it holds, so the issue tracker can be filtered by type.

| Label | Meaning                                                              |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `prd` | The issue is a PRD (product requirements document), not a work item |

Filter PRDs with `gh issue list --label prd`.
